  - Need individual timelines for the 8 indicted cops:
    - Date they joined the BCPD
    - Date they joined the GTTF
    - Earliest known date of participation in illegal activity
      - Public defenders office (via Debbie Levi):
        "**examining all cases involving these cops from the earliest dates they were known to have conducted criminal activity on duty **"
  - Gabe Dinsmoor is working on these timelines, per email from Mahrya 02.28.2019
