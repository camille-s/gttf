# README for GTTF Project

This is a README for the GTTF project that is a collaboration between Problem Forward and Blowback Productions. This is an overview of the project and will contain iterative updates so we can follow what is happening in the file. 

## Contents

1. [Report 1](#pf_gttf_report_01)
2. [Report 2](#pf_gttf_report_02)
3. [Report 3](#pf_gttf_report_03)
4. [Report 4](#pf_gttf_report_04)
5. [Report 5](#pf_gttf_report_05)

## Overview

This project folder has four subfolders:
* `data` - this folder has two types of data in it `tidy_data`, which consists of data that are organized and ready for analysis and `raw_data`, which generally consists of files received from the WK team that haven't been processed yet. These folders will not be accessible via Github, but may be produced by code in the `code` folder.  
* `code` - this folder has two types of code in it `final_code` which is code that is used in final projects transferred to WK and `raw_code` which consists of code used for exploration but not used in any final project. 
* `products` - this folder has individual products, presentations, or apps that I will be transferring to the KFC team. 
* `figures` - this folder contains one off plots that I may send to the team from time to time. 

## Reports

Inside of the `code/final_code` folder I have the individual GTTF reports that I am preparing. I will provide descriptions of these reports and point to data sets utilized in or generated by these reports. As of right now all reports for this particular client is on the PF team drive, that is shared with the a few of Blowback's members as well. 

Support files are as follows:
  - `code/final_code/bpd_arrests.R`
  - `code/final_code/census_data_map.R`
  - `code/final_code/clean_mdcs_scrape.R`
  - `code/final_code/data_setup.R`
  - `code/final_code/dataviz.R`
  - `code/final_code/network.R`
  - `code/final_code/scrape.R`

Reports are as follows. 

### pf_gttf_report_01

This is the first report, mostly focused on data tidying and understanding the data GTTF wanted from us. We took the time in `code/raw_code/kmorales/scrape.R` to cherry pick the cases needed based off of the time period BB Productions asked from us. We also cherry-picked by name of officers in question. Once aggregated we are able to produce some graphics that gives quick synopsis on what the data provides and what story the data tells.

### pf_gttf_report_02

The second report was an additive of the first. More in-depth analysis on the true impact of broken window policing and other practices. We began to see the bigger picture impact of being under arrest, becoming indicted and then going to prison. The costs that affect a multitude of citizens throughout the Baltimore City Area. Give them timelines of Police involvement and what these specifics officers were charging individuals. We also acquired quantitative data on where these arrests were and created a geograhical map for visualizing this impact. 

### pf_gttf_report_03

Maintaining more information that was not easily retrievable through previous data sources. Reached out to person's that will grant access to better datasets! Comparing arrest rates of the entire city versus just those cops. Joining more census data to compare, and how charges are distributed with dependencies on race, age and geographical location. 

### pf_gttf_report_04

Follow up and recap on current progress between teams. Update on geographical mapping progress and clearer updates on corrected timeline of events.

### pf_gttf_report_05

General recap and discussion. Began discussing more data entryways with another company. Alternative routes in aggregation of data and specifice ways on how to clean data effectively without duplicates or repitition.
